# Dude, Where's my Charge


This project was created to show EV charging stations around the user of our webpage. As electric vehilces become the norm it is important to be able to locate the available chargin staitons around oneself anytime as well as see their availability, charging capacit, and price.

This webpage will prompt the user for an address which is then geocoded via the HereAPI and displayed on a map with data from the openchargemap API. Bootstrap CDN and Tailwind CSS along with custom CSS were used to create the layout of the document.


This project was completed with code from Jackson Shiffert, John Grundey, and Kyle Miller
